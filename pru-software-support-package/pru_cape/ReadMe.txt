Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) Software Support Package 
------------------------------------------------------------
============================================================
   PRU_CAPE
============================================================

DESCRIPTION

   This directory includes demo software that is intended to run on the 
   BeagleBone / BeagleBone Black PRU Cape.  

   Pre-built binaries that can be run from an SD card or through CCS are 
   available in the "bin" directory.  
 
   The "pru_demo" directory includes AM335x StarterWare-based ARM code to load 
   and run the PRU firmware demos.  This code provides an example of how to 
   enable the PRU using a non-Linux OS.  However, Linux or CCS can also be used
   to run the PRU demos.  

   The "pru_fw" directory includes the PRU demo firmware. 

   For more details about the PRU Cape and the demos included in this package,
