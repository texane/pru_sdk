Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) Software Support Package release 1.1.x


DESCRIPTION

   The PRU Software Support Package is an add-on package that provides a framework 
   and examples for developing software for the Programmable Real-time Unit 
   sub-system and Industrial Communication Sub-System (PRU-ICSS) in the supported 
   TI processors.  The PRU-ICSS achieves deterministic, real-time processing, direct 
   access to I/Os and meets ultra-low-latency requirements. 

   This software package contains example PRU firmware code as well as application 
   loader code for the host OS. The examples demonstrate the PRU capabilities to 
   interact with and control the system and its resources.
